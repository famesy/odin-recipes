            <li>
                <h3>Prep Your Ingredients:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make sure your rice is cold and separated. If 
                        you’re using leftover rice, it should be refrigerated.
                    </li>
                    <li>Chop your vegetables and protein into bite-sized pieces.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Cook the Vegetables:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large 
                        skillet or wok over medium-high heat.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add the minced garlic and chopped onion. Sauté until 
                        fragrant and the onion is translucent, about 2 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add the mixed vegetables and cook until they are tender-crisp, 
                        around 3-4 minutes. Remove the vegetables from the skillet 
                        and set aside.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Scramble the Eggs:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In the same skillet, add a bit more oil if 
                        needed and pour in the beaten eggs. Scramble 
                        them until fully cooked. Remove the eggs from 
                        the skillet and set aside with the vegetables.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Stir-Fry the Rice:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Add the remaining oil to the skillet. Increase the heat to high.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add the cold rice, breaking up any clumps. 
                        Stir-fry for about 2-3 minutes, ensuring 
                        the rice is heated through and slightly crispy.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Combine Ingredients:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Return the cooked vegetables, scrambled eggs, and 
                        protein to the skillet. Stir well to combine.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pour in the soy sauce, oyster sauce (if using), and sesame 
                        oil. Mix everything together until well combined and heated 
                        through. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if needed.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Finish and Serve:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Stir in the chopped green onions and cook for an additional minute.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Remove from heat and transfer to serving plates.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Garnish with optional toppings like sesame seeds, chopped cilantro, 
                        sliced chili peppers, or a squeeze of lime juice.
                    </li>
